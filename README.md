In this repository you can play with different particles and emitters. The particle that I chose in this repository was fire. In order to see the fire particles you must click your mouse and there will be flashes of orange and yellow fire particles. If you want to choose another particle edit it on line 113 and if you want a different color edit lines 43-54.
